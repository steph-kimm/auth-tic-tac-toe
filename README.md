# Tic Tac Toe

## Objective:

* Build a tic tac toe game with user authentication using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery 

You can see the deployed game [here](https://steph-kimm.github.io/auth-tic-tac-toe/).

This game was used as practice with user authentication. 
To play I drew a simple wireframe which can be seen below.
